# Qubit Characteristic Simulation

This project aims to simulate some characteristic processes of qubit samples, such as spectroscopy, Rabi oscillation, Ramsey oscillation, etc.

The project uses only very simple theories of quantum mechanics, so it can be easily understood.

Everybody can use this project to do everything. It is a totally free project.
